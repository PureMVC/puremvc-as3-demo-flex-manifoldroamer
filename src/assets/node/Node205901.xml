<Description><![CDATA[
The AsyncCommand utility offers a solution to the problem of executing a series of commands each of which may need to complete one or more asynchronous operations before the next command is executed. 
]]></Description>						

<ReleaseNotes><![CDATA[<B>Features in Version 1.0</B>
  * IAsyncCommand interface defines the methods required for an asynchronous command, which at the moment is only setOnComplete, which sets a callback method for the IAsyncCommand implementer to call when it has completed its task.
  * AsyncCommand class extends the framework SimpleCommand class and implements IAsyncCommand.
  * AsyncMacroCommand class extends Notifier and implements IAsyncCommand. Accepts IAsyncCommands or ICommands for subcommands. This means any combination of SimpleCommand, MacroCommand, AsyncCommand or AsyncMacroCommand.
  * Standard and MultiCore versions included.
