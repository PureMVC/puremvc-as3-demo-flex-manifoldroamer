<B>Installation on Mac with MAMP</B>
1.) Download MAMP from  <font color="#0000FF"><a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php</A></font>
2.) Install MAMP, by default it goes in the Applications folder.
3.) Click on the MAMP icon to start the MAMP Control Panel. MAMP will prompt for your user password. After entering your password the control panel will start the Apache server and MySQL server and the MAMP start page will appear with links to PHPMyAdmin and other tools.
4.) Open the MAMP installation folder. In the MAMP folder open the 'htdocs' folder. By default this is where MAMP will look for index when browsing to  http://localhost:80. Place the index.php, org and images folders in the htdocs folder.
5.) Browse to  http://localhost in your web browser to run the demo.

<B>Installation on Windows with XAMPP</B>
1.) Download XAMPP from  <font color="#0000FF"><a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" target="_blank">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html</A></font>
2.) Double click the xampp-win32-1.6.8.exe or current version. It will prompt you for a location to extract the files.
3.) In the xampp folder, double click the setup_xampp.bat file to set up xampp.
4.) Double click the xampp-control.exe when the setup is complete. The XAMPP Control Panel allows you to start and stop the Apache and MySQL server as well as a couple of others. For the demo only Apache and MySQL server should be running. The Control Panel starts and stops the servers, but does not stop then when you exit the Control Panel like MAMP does, so make sure to turn off your server if you do not want it on before exiting the Control Panel.
5.) Open the xampp folder. In there locate and open the htdocs folder. By default this is where XAMPP will look for index when browsing to  http://localhost. Place the index.php, org and images folders in the htdocs folder.
6.) Browse to  http://localhost in your web browser to run the demo.
