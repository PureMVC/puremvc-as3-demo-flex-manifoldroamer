]]></Description>						

<ReleaseNotes><![CDATA[<B>Changes in 1.2.1</B>
  * Moved constructor actions to onRegister. 

<B>Changes in 1.2</B>
  * Added MultiCore support.
  * No Standard version functionality changes except renaming source tree, therefore, there is no need to migrate Standard version apps to 1.2 unless you're also migrating to MultiCore. 

<B>Changes in 1.1</B>
  * Moved source code into src folder. No functionality changed. 

<B>Features in 1.0</B>
  * Manages an XML Database with the information about the main application window's position, size and state (WindowMetrics)
  * Reads the Window Metrics at startup, applies to the main window then sends a notification that the window is ready to be shown.
  * Allows the window to be sized and positioned BEFORE being shown so that it doesn't flash up at a default size, then resize, causing visual repaint. 

See the demos CodePeek and RSSHeadlines for example use of this utility.
