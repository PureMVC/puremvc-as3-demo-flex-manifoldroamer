Occasionally, for testing a service before it is online, you may need a Proxy that acts as though it has asynchronously contacted a server and retrieved data. You may also need for it to simulate random load times, timeouts, and failures. This can be for testing purposes or as a stand-in until the actual service is in place so that client development can proceed.

The Flex-based demo called Loadup as Ordered provides an example use of this utility.
