]]></Description>						

<ReleaseNotes><![CDATA[<B>Changes in 1.2</B>
  * Added MultiCore support.
  * No Standard version functionality changes except renaming source tree, therefore, there is no need to migrate Standard version apps to 1.2 unless you're also migrating to MultiCore. 

<B>Changes in 1.1</B>
  * Moved source code into src folder. No functionality changed. 

<B>Features in 1.0</B>
  * Abstract class for representing an XML database
  * Reads existing XML file or creates from a skeleton and persists
  * Handles File I/O automatically
  * Provides a way to parse the XML tree and delegate nodes to different proxies 
  * Command for persisting arbitrary XML databases
  * Application can have as many XML databases as needed 

AIR applications can to store, retrieve and manipulate structured data. A great way to do this is with XML, since AS3 gives us powerful tools in E4X for manipulation of the data.
For now, see the CodePeek demo to understand how to implement in your app.
