<P>I'm pleased to announce that Russia has become the fifth nation to join the PureMVC Union!</P>
<P>Along with the Germany, China, France, and English-speaking countries, Russia now enjoys a native-language resource for learning the PureMVC Framework.</P>
<P>It has taken several months of hard work, and the largest group of translators yet working to create the final product from the original document.</P>
<P>But finally, the PureMVC Implementation Idioms and Best Practices document is available in Russian thanks to this hard-working group of translators: Denis Sheremetov, Denis Volokh, Dmitry 'Reijii', Roman Pavlenk and Rostislav ‘RostislavR’ Siryk.</P>
<P>A heartfelt spasiba goes out to Denis and crew - your efforts are much appreciated!<BR/>
